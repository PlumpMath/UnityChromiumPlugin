The Unity Chromium Plugin
--------------------------

This plugin wraps Chromium (http://berkelium.org) into a thin C layer, and provides a C# script that can be attached to Unity objects.

This is all rather an unuseable mess right now - it's not done yet.

Based on the UnityBerkeliumPlugin project.

Scattered notes:

- This is a plugin using native code, so it only works with Unity Pro, and it doesn't work inside a browser.

- [Copy distro files to root of Unity project folder and root of release folder. Copy UnityChromium.dll to Assets\Foo\Plugins.]

- There is a test project in "test-project/Assets/ChromiumUnityTest.unity". It contains a plane with the script attached. You can edit the width and height and the URL.

- The URL has to start with a protocol (http:// for example). I don't know why it doesn't work without it.

- When you want mouse events to work, your object needs a mesh collider (or needs to be a GUI texture).

- There is a log file in "test-project" (when using the Unity editor).

- When you release a project, you must copy [release files] to your executable's directory.

- I release this code under the same license as Chromium itself, which is a BSD-style license. See the LICENSE file.


Known issues:
- It doesn't work at all.
